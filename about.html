        <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
        <p>BuyBeta Supermarket was incorporated in 2020 with operations flagging off 23rd February, same year. 
            The idea emanated from a strong desire to build a wholly indigenous retail chain. Within five years from inception from a 
            single branch, BuyBeta Supermarket has grown into four branches, well run and positioned to become one of Africa's fastest growing brands in the retail sector. 
            The BuyBeta Supermarket anywhere it is found, is a hub where shoppers needs are met in a one stop location.
